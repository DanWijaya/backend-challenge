{'web_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/09/books/review/thunderclap-laura-cumming.html', 'snippet': 'In her memoir “Thunderclap,” the British art critic Laura Cumming explores her passion for the virtuosic images of everyday life by painters from Dutch art’s golden age.', 'lead_paragraph': '“We have certain recollections,” Marcel Proust once wrote, “that resemble the Dutch painting of our memory.” Laura Cumming doesn’t quote these words in her genre-defying book “Thunderclap: A Memoir of Art and Life and Sudden Death,” but their spirit suffuses its pages. Like Proust, Cumming suggests that we recall the past through pictures, and like him, she identifies such pictures with the paintings of the 17th-century Dutch, who made enduring images from the humble materials of ordinary life.', 'source': 'The New York Times', 'headline.main': 'When Life Resembles a 17th-Century Dutch Painting', 'headline.kicker': 'Nonfiction', 'headline.content_kicker': None, 'headline.print_headline': 'A Life in Pictures', 'headline.name': None, 'headline.seo': None, 'headline.sub': None, 'pub_date': '2023-07-09T09:00:19+0000'}
